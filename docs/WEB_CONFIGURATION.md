## Features

- **Browser-Based Configuration**: Configure device from any web browser
- **AP Configuration**: Set SSID, password, channel, and auto-start
- **Station Configuration**: Save WiFi credentials and auto-connect settings
- **Password Security**: Passwords are not displayed, only prompted for updates
- **Real-Time Status**: View current saved configurations
- **Easy Clear**: Remove saved configurations with one click
- **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive design works on phones and tablets

## Accessing the Web Interface

## Password Security

### Not Exposed in Web Interface

- **Saved passwords are NEVER displayed** in the web interface
- Password fields are always empty when viewing existing configurations
- This prevents passwords from being visible on shared/public screens

### Updating Passwords

To update a password:

1. **Leave field empty** to keep current password unchanged
2. **Enter new password** to change/update password

### Best Practices

‚úì Use strong passwords (8+ characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
‚úì Don't share web interface access on untrusted networks
‚úì Clear configurations before disposing of devices
‚úì Change passwords regularly for security

‚ö† **Security Note**: While passwords are not displayed in the web interface,
they are stored unencrypted in NVS and can be retrieved via serial console.
Physical access to device = potential access to credentials.

## Configuration Workflow

### Recommended Setup Process

1. **Initial Setup**
   - Connect to device via default AP
   - Access web interface at `http://192.168.4.1`
   - Configure desired mode (AP or Station)
   - Save configuration
   - Restart device

2. **Verification**
   - Device should boot into configured mode
   - Access web interface at new IP/address
   - Verify settings in **‚öôÔ∏è Config** page

3. **Updates**
   - Make changes as needed
   - Leave password fields empty if not changing
   - Save and restart

### Factory Reset via Web

To completely reset configurations:

1. Navigate to **‚öôÔ∏è Config**
2. Click **üóëÔ∏è Clear Config** for AP section
3. Click **üóëÔ∏è Clear Config** for Station section  
4. Restart device

Device will boot in IDLE mode with no saved configurations.

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Access Web Interface

**Problem**: Browser can't connect

**Solutions**:
- Check WiFi connection to device
- Verify correct IP address
- In AP mode, try: `http://192.168.4.1`
- Check if web server is started (serial: `webserver status`)
- Restart web server (serial: `webserver stop` then `webserver start`)

### Configuration Not Saving

**Problem**: Save button doesn't work or shows error

**Solutions**:
- Check SSID length (1-32 characters)
- Check password length (8-63 for AP, 0-63 for Station)
- Ensure no special characters causing issues
- Check serial output for error messages
- Try clearing existing config first, then save new one

### Device Not Auto-Starting/Connecting

**Problem**: Saved config but device doesn't auto-boot

**Solutions**:
- Verify auto-start/auto-connect checkbox was checked
- Check with serial commands:
  - `ap show` - view AP config
  - `station show` - view Station config
- Remember: AP takes priority over Station
- Ensure proper device restart (not just WiFi off/on)

### Password Field Confusion

**Problem**: Not sure if password is saved correctly

**Solutions**:
- Leave password field empty = keeps current password
- Enter new password = changes password
- If unsure, clear config and re-enter all details
- Use serial commands to verify:
  - `ap show` - shows AP config (password visible)
  - `station show` - shows Station config (password masked)

## Integration with Serial Commands

Web interface and serial commands work together:

### View Configurations

**Web**: Navigate to **‚öôÔ∏è Config** page
**Serial**: `ap show` and `station show`

### Save Configurations

**Web**: Use save buttons in config page
**Serial**: `ap save ...` and `station save ...`

### Clear Configurations

**Web**: Click **üóëÔ∏è Clear Config** buttons
**Serial**: `ap clear` and `station clear`

### Check Status

**Web**: Navigate to **üìä Status** page
**Serial**: `status` command

Both methods achieve the same result - use whichever is more convenient!

## Mobile Access

The web interface is fully responsive and works well on mobile devices:

### Tips for Mobile Use

1. **Portrait Mode**: Works best for form filling
2. **Landscape Mode**: Better for viewing navigation menu
3. **Saved Credentials**: Use browser's password manager for convenience
4. **Bookmarks**: Bookmark the config page for quick access
5. **Desktop Mode**: Switch to desktop site if needed (browser option)

### Mobile Workflow

1. Connect phone to ESP32 WiFi
2. Open browser
3. Go to `http://192.168.4.1`
4. Tap **‚öôÔ∏è Config**
5. Fill forms
6. Save configurations
7. Disconnect and restart device

## Advanced Usage

### Scripted Configuration

For automated setup, you can POST to the configuration endpoints:

```bash
# Save AP configuration
curl -X POST http://192.168.4.1/config/ap \
  -d "ssid=MyAP&password=MyPass123&channel=6&autostart=1"

# Save Station configuration
curl -X POST http://192.168.4.1/config/station \
  -d "ssid=HomeWiFi&password=HomePass&autoconnect=1"

# Clear configurations
curl -X POST http://192.168.4.1/config/clear -d "type=ap"
curl -X POST http://192.168.4.1/config/clear -d "type=station"
```

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/config` | GET | Display configuration page |
