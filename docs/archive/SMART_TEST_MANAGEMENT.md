# Automatic Test Management - Smart Test Lifecycle

## 🎯 Overview

The web interface now features **automatic test lifecycle management** that intelligently handles running tests when starting new ones. Users no longer need to manually stop previous tests - the system handles it automatically.

## ✨ Smart Test Management

### Automatic Test Stopping

When starting a new test while another is running, the system automatically:
1. **Detects** the running test
2. **Stops** the previous test cleanly
3. **Waits** for cleanup (100ms delay)
4. **Starts** the new test immediately
5. **Logs** the action to serial console

### Affected Test Types

#### 1. Latency & Jitter Tests (`/latency/start`)

**Old Behavior:**
```
User clicks "Start New Test" while test running
→ Error message: "Test already running. Stop current test first."
→ User must click "Stop Test"
→ Wait for stop confirmation
→ Click "Start New Test" again
→ Test starts
```

**New Behavior:**
```
User clicks "Start New Test" while test running
→ System automatically stops previous test
→ 100ms cleanup delay
→ New test starts immediately
→ Success message displayed
```

**Implementation:**
```cpp
if (currentLatencyState == LATENCY_RUNNING) {
    Serial.println("🛑 Stopping previous latency test before starting new one...");
    stopLatencyTest();
    delay(100); // Brief delay to ensure clean stop
}

success = startLatencyTest(config);
```

#### 2. iPerf Tests (`/iperf/start`)

**Old Behavior:**
```
User submits new iPerf configuration while test running
→ Error message: "Test already running. Stop current test first."
→ User must navigate back
→ Click "Stop Test"
→ Wait for stop
→ Click "Start New Test" again
→ Test starts
```

**New Behavior:**
```
User submits new iPerf configuration while test running
→ System automatically stops previous test
→ 100ms cleanup delay
→ New test starts with new configuration
→ Success message displayed
```

**Implementation:**
```cpp
if (currentIperfState == IPERF_RUNNING) {
    Serial.println("🛑 Stopping previous iPerf test before starting new one...");
    stopIperfTest();
    delay(100); // Brief delay to ensure clean stop
}

if (config.mode == IPERF_SERVER) {
    success = startIperfServer(config);
} else {
    success = startIperfClient(config);
}
```

## 🎨 User Experience Improvements

### Before (Manual Management)

**Scenario:** User wants to change latency test target from `8.8.8.8` to `google.com`

**Steps Required:**
1. Click "Stop Test" button
2. Confirm stop dialog
3. Wait for redirect
4. Click "Start New Test"
5. Fill in new configuration
6. Submit form
7. Test starts

**Total:** 7 steps, 3 page loads

### After (Automatic Management)

**Scenario:** User wants to change latency test target from `8.8.8.8` to `google.com`

**Steps Required:**
1. Click "Start New Test"
2. Fill in new configuration
3. Submit form
4. Test starts (previous stopped automatically)

**Total:** 4 steps, 2 page loads

**Improvement:** 43% fewer steps, 33% fewer page loads

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Cleanup Process

**Stop Sequence:**
1. Check if test is running
2. Call stop function (stopLatencyTest/stopIperfTest)
3. Wait 100ms for cleanup
4. Start new test

**Why 100ms delay?**
- Allows UDP/TCP sockets to close properly
- Ensures task cleanup completes
- Prevents resource conflicts
- Minimal user-perceived delay

### State Management

**Latency Test States:**
```cpp
enum LatencyTestState {
  LATENCY_IDLE = 0,      // No test running, can start
  LATENCY_RUNNING = 1,   // Test in progress, auto-stop available
  LATENCY_COMPLETED = 2, // Test finished, can start new
  LATENCY_ERROR = 3      // Test failed, can start new
};
```

**iPerf Test States:**
```cpp
enum IperfState {
  IPERF_IDLE = 0,        // No test running, can start
  IPERF_RUNNING = 1,     // Test in progress, auto-stop available
  IPERF_STOPPING = 2     // Test stopping, wait before starting
};
```

### Serial Console Logging

**Latency Test:**
```
🛑 Stopping previous latency test before starting new one...
✅ Latency test stopped
🚀 Starting latency test...
```

**iPerf Test:**
```
🛑 Stopping previous iPerf test before starting new one...
✅ iPerf test stopped
🌐 Starting iPerf test...
```

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

**Queue System:**
```
User starts test A while test B running
→ Test B completes
→ Test A starts automatically
→ Queue multiple tests
```

**Grace Period:**
```
Test running < 5 seconds
→ Show warning: "Test just started, really restart?"
→ Prevent accidental restarts
```

**Smart Detection:**
```
New config identical to running test
→ "Test already running with same config"
→ Don't restart unnecessarily
```

**Result Preservation:**
```
Auto-stop saves partial results
→ "Previous test incomplete (stopped)"
→ Compare with new test
```
