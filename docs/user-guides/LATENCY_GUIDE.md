## 🔧 Test Types Explained

### 1. UDP Echo Test (`latency test`)
- **Method**: Sends UDP packets and measures round-trip time
- **Default Target**: 8.8.8.8:7 (Google DNS echo port)
- **Best For**: Basic network latency measurement
- **Packet Count**: 50 packets (configurable)
- **Interval**: 1000ms between packets

### 2. TCP Connect Test (`latency test tcp`)
- **Method**: Measures TCP connection establishment time
- **Default Target**: 8.8.8.8:80 (HTTP port)
- **Best For**: Testing connection overhead and firewall impact
- **Measures**: SYN → SYN-ACK → ACK handshake time

### 3. HTTP Request Test (`latency test http`)
- **Method**: Full HTTP GET request and response measurement
- **Default Target**: www.google.com:80
- **Best For**: Application-level latency including DNS resolution
- **Measures**: Complete request/response cycle

## 📈 Metrics & Statistics

### Latency Measurements
- **Minimum Latency**: Fastest round-trip time observed
- **Maximum Latency**: Slowest round-trip time observed  
- **Average Latency**: Mean latency across all successful packets
- **Jitter (Average)**: Average variation between consecutive packets
- **Maximum Jitter**: Largest variation observed between packets

### Reliability Metrics
- **Packets Sent**: Total number of test packets transmitted
- **Packets Received**: Number of successful responses received
- **Packets Lost**: Number of packets that didn't receive responses
- **Packet Loss %**: Percentage of lost packets

### Network Quality Score
The system calculates an overall network quality score (0-100) based on:
- **Packet Loss**: Heavy penalty for lost packets (2x multiplier)
- **High Latency**: Penalties for >50ms, >100ms, >200ms latency
- **High Jitter**: Penalties for >10ms, >20ms, >50ms jitter

**Quality Scoring Guidelines**:
- **90-100**: Excellent (Gaming/VoIP ready)
- **70-89**: Good (General browsing/streaming)
- **50-69**: Fair (Basic connectivity)
- **0-49**: Poor (Connection issues present)

## 🎨 Visual Status Indicators (Feather Board)

When using the Adafruit Feather ESP32-S3 TFT board with NeoPixel:

| Color | Status |
|-------|---------|
| 🔵 **Cyan** | Latency test in progress |
| 🟢 **Green** | Test completed successfully |
| 🔴 **Red** | Test error or failure |
| 🟡 **Yellow** | Warning (high latency/jitter) |

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Default Test Parameters
```cpp
// UDP Echo Test Defaults
Target Host: "8.8.8.8"
Target Port: 7 (Echo)
Packet Count: 50
Packet Size: 32 bytes
Interval: 1000ms
Timeout: 5000ms

### Memory Usage
- **Latency Buffer**: 32 recent measurements for jitter calculation
- **Results Storage**: Up to 100 individual ping results
- **Heap Usage**: ~8KB additional RAM during testing

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Not connected to WiFi"**
- Ensure device is connected: `mode station` → `connect <ssid> <password>`

**"Connection failed" (TCP Test)**
- Target host may be blocking connections
- Try different target: `latency test tcp 8.8.8.8`

**High packet loss**
- Check WiFi signal strength
- Network congestion may be present
- Try different target host

**Inconsistent results**
- Network conditions may be variable
- Run multiple tests for average performance
- Use `jitter` command for quick stability check

### Debug Commands
```bash
# Check current connection
ESP32> status

# Test basic connectivity  
ESP32> latency test 8.8.8.8

# Monitor test progress
ESP32> latency status

# View detailed results
