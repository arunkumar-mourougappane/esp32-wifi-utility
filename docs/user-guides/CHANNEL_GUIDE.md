## 🔧 Analysis Features

### 1. Congestion Scoring (0-100%)
The system calculates a comprehensive congestion score for each channel based on:
- **Network Count**: Number of detected networks (0-50 points)
- **Signal Strength**: Strongest signal impact (0-30 points)
- **Average RSSI**: Overall signal level (0-20 points)

**Scoring Guidelines**:
- **0-30%**: Low congestion (excellent for AP use)
- **30-70%**: Medium congestion (acceptable with monitoring)
- **70-100%**: High congestion (avoid for new AP deployment)

### 2. Channel Overlap Analysis
WiFi channels in the 2.4GHz band overlap significantly:
- **Channel 1**: Overlaps with channels 1-5
- **Channel 6**: Overlaps with channels 4-8  
- **Channel 11**: Overlaps with channels 9-13

The system analyzes overlap patterns to provide accurate interference predictions.

### 3. Interference Detection
Advanced pattern recognition identifies:
- **Non-WiFi Interference**: Microwave ovens, Bluetooth devices, etc.
- **Unusual Signal Patterns**: Large RSSI gaps indicating external interference
- **Non-Standard Channel Usage**: Heavy traffic on overlapping channels

### 4. Smart Recommendations
The recommendation engine prioritizes:
1. **Standard Non-Overlapping Channels**: 1, 6, 11 (preferred)
2. **Low Congestion Scores**: Channels with minimal traffic
3. **Signal Isolation**: Channels with reduced interference
4. **Future-Proofing**: Considerations for network growth

### Channel Recommendations
```
💡 === Channel Recommendations ===
🎯 Recommended channels for AP deployment (in order of preference):
  1. Channel 5 - 0.0% congestion, 0 networks, 2432 MHz
  2. Channel 13 - 0.0% congestion, 0 networks, 2472 MHz  
  3. Channel 1 - 45.2% congestion, 5 networks, 2412 MHz
  4. Channel 11 - 52.8% congestion, 4 networks, 2462 MHz
  5. Channel 6 - 78.5% congestion, 8 networks, 2437 MHz

📋 Recommendation factors:
  • Channels 1, 6, 11 are preferred (non-overlapping)
  • Lower congestion scores are better
  • Fewer networks mean less competition
  • Consider signal strength and overlap

4. **Multi-Point Testing**: Test from different physical locations
5. **Time-Based Analysis**: Consider peak vs. off-peak usage patterns

### Channel Selection Guidelines
- **New Deployment**: Choose channels with <30% congestion
- **Existing Network**: Monitor performance and switch if congestion >70%
- **High-Density Areas**: Prefer channels 1, 6, 11 despite congestion
- **Rural Areas**: Consider non-standard channels if significantly clearer
- **Enterprise**: Coordinate channel assignments across multiple APs

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Channel analysis requires station mode"**
- Solution: Switch to station mode: `mode station`

**High congestion on all channels**
- Dense urban environment is normal
- Consider 5GHz band if available
- Use monitoring to find quieter time periods

**Inconsistent results between scans**
- Network conditions are dynamic
- Run multiple scans for average conditions
- Enable continuous monitoring for trends

**No interference detected despite issues**
- Some interference types are difficult to detect
- Consider external spectrum analyzer for validation
- Check for non-WiFi devices in 2.4GHz band

# Check WiFi mode and status
ESP32> status

# Verify station mode is active
ESP32> mode station
